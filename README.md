## üìå Important Tips Before You Start

1. **Learn how to learn:** Don‚Äôt rely on someone to guide you step by step. Try, search, and learn independently.
2. **Evaluate the instructor:** Before starting any course, check the instructor‚Äôs background on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com).
3. **English is essential:** Don't limit yourself to Arabic content. Understanding English (even partially) is necessary to keep up with global resources.
4. **Start building skills early:** Don‚Äôt wait until graduation to learn job-ready skills.
5. **Don‚Äôt underestimate university subjects:** Even if the teaching quality is poor, most subjects are useful and can help later in your career.
